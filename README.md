## Overview

BMC1usd is the **internal utility token** of BMC1 BeMyCoverage1 LLC, designed for a **blockchain-based car insurance ecosystem**. 
It functions as a **stable $1 settlement token** for:

- Policy premium payments  
- Refunds (Money-Back incentives)  
- Claims / total-loss payouts  
- Treasury and liquidity management  

BMC1usd is **non-ERC20**, fully internal, and ledger-based. 
It interacts with **vaults, policy NFTs, oracles, and public ERC20 tokens (BMC1, BMC1x, and BMC1g)** 
without being tradable externally.

## Key Features & What It Does

1. **Stable & Predictable**
   - Always pegged 1:1 to USD
   - Backed by stablecoins (USDC, USDT) and yearly converted public tokens

2. **Automated Policy Integration**
   - Tracks driver performance over a 5-year policy term
   - Money-Back incentives:
     - **65%** for good drivers (no severe accidents)
     - **35%** for higher-risk drivers
   - Minor ticket deductions automatically applied (2.5% per minor ticket, max 5 tickets)
   - Severe violations or at-fault accidents automatically adjust MB and policy status
     
3. **Vault & Ledger Interaction**
   - **Premium Vault:** Receives premiums  
   - **Refund Vault:** Holds accrued MB percentages  
   - **Claims / LP Vault:** Pays out accidents and severe penalties  
   - **Treasury Reserve Vault:** Receives yearly public token conversions  
   - **Trust Vault:** Locks public tokens for credibility and backing  
   - Mint / Burn logic ensures all BMC1usd movements are **fully accounted for** 

4. **Governance & Control**
   - Multi-sig admin controls for emergency pause, treasury management, or dispute resolution
   - NO GREEDY CEO mentality using Self-DAO automation that handles MB adjustments,
     policy lifecycle, and yearly conversions

5. **Investor & Ecosystem Integration**
   - Any Polgon Based Public ERC20 tokens contribute to BMC1usd backing
   - Supports trust, credibility, and long-term ecosystem sustainability

## How It Works (Step-By-Step)

1. **Customer pays policy premium** → BMC1usd is minted 1:1 to USD and credited to the Premium Vault.  
2. **MB allocation tracked** → Refund Vault records potential Money-Back % (65% / 35%) per driver.  
3. **Oracle / internal validator monitors events** → Minor tickets, severe violations, accidents.  
4. **Adjustments applied automatically** → MB % is updated, claims or penalties affect vault balances.  
5. **Yearly public token conversion** → Fixed $ value of public tokens (BMC1/BMC1x/BMC1g) is converted → Treasury → BMC1usd vaults.  
6. **At 5-year policy maturity** → Eligible MB is released to user; policy can be renewed with new ledger cycle.

## What BMC1usd is **NOT**

- **Not a public cryptocurrency**:
      Cannot be traded outside the BMC1 BeMyCoverage1 ecosystem.  
- **Not ERC20 / not for external exchange**:
      Fully internal ledger-based token.  
- **Not a security or investment product**:
      Only used for insurance operations and internal accounting.  
- **Not subject to market price fluctuations**:
      Always pegged 1:1 to USD regardless of ERC20 token values.
