# BMC1USD — Definition and Purpose

Overview

BMC1USD is a Polygon-based ERC-20 utility token with 18 decimals, designed to function as a USD-denominated internal accounting unit within the Be My Coverage1 (BMC1) platform. Its primary purpose is to represent dollar-equivalent values for premiums, coverage limits, reserves, and internal settlements related to vehicle coverage coordination services.

BMC1USD is not intended to function as a general-purpose stablecoin, investment vehicle, or fiat currency substitute, and it is not marketed or designed as such.

# Denomination and Value Representation

Each unit of BMC1USD is denominated as equivalent to one United States Dollar (USD) for internal accounting purposes within the BMC1 ecosystem:

## 1 BMC1USD ≡ 1 USD (accounting denomination only)

This denomination is used solely as a standardized reference unit to simplify premium calculations, policy limits, risk scoring, and settlement logic inside the platform.

BMC1USD does not represent a claim on fiat currency, legal tender, or any off-chain asset unless explicitly stated under a separate, governed redemption mechanism.

## Token Characteristics

Network: Polygon (EVM-compatible)
Standard: ERC-20
Decimals: 18
Supply Model: Dynamic (minted and burned according to system activity)
Peg Mechanism: Accounting denomination, not market-enforced
Oracles: Not required in the initial design
Collateralization: Not required in the initial design

# Supply Behavior
BMC1USD does not have a fixed maximum supply at inception. Instead, supply is managed dynamically in accordance with platform activity:

# Tokens may be minted in association with policy creation, premium allocation, or internal accounting events.

# Tokens may be burned upon policy expiration, closure, cancellation, or settlement finalization.

# Total circulating supply reflects active system liabilities and accounting balances, not speculative demand.

This model aligns with insurance-style accounting, where liabilities expand and contract based on active 
coverage obligations.

## Utility and Scope of Use

BMC1USD is used exclusively within the Be My Coverage1 platform for purposes including, but not limited to:
Policy premium representation
Coverage limit denomination
Internal reserve accounting
Claims settlement accounting
Risk and scoring normalization
Vault-based fund allocation logic

### NOTE :  BMC1USD is not intended for speculative trading, yield generation, or use as a general payment instrument outside the BMC1 ecosystem.

Legal and Regulatory Positioning
BMC1USD is designed as a utility and accounting token, not as:
A fiat-backed stablecoin
A security or investment contract
A deposit instrument
A promise of redemption into fiat currency
The token does not, by itself, confer ownership rights, profit participation, dividends, or governance authority unless explicitly defined in separate governing documents.
Any future redemption mechanisms, collateralization models, or integrations with regulated financial institutions would be subject to additional disclosures, technical safeguards, and legal compliance layers.

## Evolution and Upgradeability

The BMC1USD design is intentionally modular and extensible. Future versions may introduce:
Collateral-backed redemption mechanisms
Oracle-assisted pricing logic
Risk-adjusted minting constraints
Governance controls
Regulatory-compliant settlement pathways

Such features, if implemented, would be documented separately and would not retroactively alter the original intent or classification of BMC1USD.

### Summary Statement

BMC1USD is a Polygon-based ERC-20 accounting token denominated in USD terms, created to enable transparent, 
auditable, and standardized value representation within the Be My Coverage1 vehicle coverage coordination platform.
