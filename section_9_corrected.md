## 9. Premium Distribution Flow (Corrected Model)

Premium distribution in BMC1 BeMyCoverage1 LLC follows a **2-layer allocation system**:

1. **Money-Back Reserve (MB Reserve)** – based on the policy type (65% or 35%)  
2. **Liquidity Pool (LP) Portion** – the remaining premium, which funds claims, operations, and reserves

This ensures:

- Refund obligations are protected
- Company liquidity is sustainable
- Operations and reserves are funded proportionally

### **Good Driver Group (65% MB Plan)**

If customer pays Premium `P`:

- **Refund Liability (MB Reserve)** = `P × 0.65` → locked in Refund Vault  
- **Company Liquidity Pool (LP Portion)** = `P × 0.35` → distributed below

**LP Portion Allocation (35% of P)**

| Use                 | % of LP Portion | Actual % of Premium |
|---------------------|-----------------|---------------|
| Claims Vault        | 60%             | 21%           |
| Operations Vault    | 25%             |  8.75%        |
| Reserve Vault       | 15%             | 5.25%         |
| **Total LP**        | 100%            | 35%           |

### **Ticket Deductions (Non-Severe Violations)**

Non-severe tickets reduce the MB Reserve and **increase the LP portion**:

- Each non-severe ticket deducts 2.5% from MB Reserve  
- Max 5 tickets per 5-year policy period  
- MB Reserve cannot go below zero
