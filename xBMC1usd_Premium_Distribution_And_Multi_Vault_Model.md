# 1. Purpose of This Document

This document defines how every premium payment is distributed across multiple internal vaults to ensure:

- the company can pay accident claims
- the company can pay operating expenses
- the company can grow long-term reserves
- the company can guarantee Money-Back (MB) payouts
- the company can survive catastrophic loss events

This document also answers the major sustainability concern:

> If we refund 65% (or 35%) back to customers, where does the rest go and how do we remain profitable?

---

# 2. Key Concept: The Premium Is Not Just "Refund vs Company"

A premium cannot be treated as:

- refund portion
- leftover portion

Instead, the premium must be split into multiple structured buckets.

This is how real insurance works.

---

# 3. The Multi-Vault System (Core Architecture)

Every policy premium is split into two master categories:

## A) Refund Escrow Vault (MB Vault)
Funds reserved for the customer’s future refund.

## B) Insurance Liquidity Vault (LP Vault)
Funds reserved for company sustainability and claims settlement.

But the LP Vault is not a single pool.

It is subdivided into specialized sub-vaults.

---

# 4. The Official Vault Architecture

BMC1 BeMyCoverage1 LLC should operate the following vaults:

| Vault Name | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| Refund Escrow Vault (MB Vault) | holds customer money-back reserve |
| Claims Vault | pays accident settlements |
| Catastrophic Reserve Vault | pays major loss events |
| Operating Vault | pays salaries, legal, infrastructure |
| Growth Vault | marketing, partnerships, expansion |
| Reinsurance Vault | future third-party coverage protection |
| Profit / Treasury Vault | long-term sustainability and stability |
| Public Token Trust Vault | holds BMC1/BMC1x/BMC1g locked reserves |
| Stable Reserve Vault | holds USDC/USDT collateral backing |

This is the recommended institutional-grade design.

---

# 5. Two Driver Groups (Your Model)

You currently have two core groups:

## Group A: Good Drivers
- 65% Money-Back (MB)
- 35% Liquidity Portion (LP)

## Group B: High Risk / SR22 Drivers
- 35% Money-Back (MB)
- 65% Liquidity Portion (LP)

---

# 6. Master Premium Distribution Formula

Let:

- `P = total premium paid`
- `MB_rate = money back percentage`
- `LP_rate = liquidity pool percentage`

Then:

MB_rate + LP_rate = 1.00


And:

MB_amount = P × MB_rate
LP_amount = P × LP_rate


---

# 7. Group A Premium Formula (Good Driver 65%)

For Group A:

- MB_rate = 0.65
- LP_rate = 0.35

So:

MB_amount = P × 0.65
LP_amount = P × 0.35


---

# 8. Group B Premium Formula (SR22 35%)

For Group B:

- MB_rate = 0.35
- LP_rate = 0.65

So:

MB_amount = P × 0.35
LP_amount = P × 0.65


---

# 9. The Real Sustainability Problem (Investor-Level Explanation)

If you simply refund 65% at the end of 5 years, investors will ask:

- where is profit coming from?
- what happens during high claim years?
- what if many policies mature at once?
- what if claims exceed expected loss ratio?

Therefore:

### the LP portion must be structured like a true insurance balance sheet.

---

# 10. LP Sub-Vault Distribution Model

The LP portion should be split into 6 operational vault categories.

This is the recommended LP allocation model:

| LP Sub-Vault | Purpose | % of LP |
|-------------|---------|---------|
| Claims Vault | normal accident payouts | 55% |
| Catastrophic Reserve Vault | rare extreme losses | 15% |
| Operating Vault | salaries, staff, infrastructure | 12% |
| Growth Vault | marketing, partnerships, onboarding | 8% |
| Reinsurance Vault | future protection layer | 5% |
| Profit / Treasury Vault | retained earnings + stability | 5% |

Total = 100% of LP

---

# 11. Why Claims Vault Must Be the Largest

Insurance is primarily a claims-paying business.

Claims are the number one liability.

If Claims Vault is underfunded, the ecosystem fails immediately.

Therefore:

- Claims Vault should always be the largest LP portion.

---

# 12. Why Catastrophic Reserve Must Exist

Most insurance collapses because of catastrophic clusters:

- storms
- multi-car pileups
- fraud rings
- legal class action events
- inflation-based repair cost surges

Catastrophic Reserve is the survival vault.

It should be untouchable except for rare events.

---

# 13. Why Operating Vault Must Exist

Blockchain does not remove real-world costs.

Operating costs include:

- payroll
- legal compliance
- customer support
- cloud hosting
- oracle subscription costs
- claims adjuster services
- private investigators (fraud)

Therefore:

Operating Vault is mandatory.

---

# 14. Why Growth Vault Is Not Optional

Growth vault funds:

- new state expansions
- marketing campaigns
- referral programs
- partnerships with repair shops
- integrations with vehicle APIs

Without growth, the token ecosystem stagnates.

---

# 15. Why Reinsurance Vault Matters

Reinsurance is what protects major insurers.

Even if BMC1 BeMyCoverage1 LLC begins decentralized, the future can include:

- institutional reinsurance partners
- decentralized risk pools
- third-party coverage contracts

The Reinsurance Vault prepares for that future.

---

# 16. Profit / Treasury Vault Purpose

This vault ensures:

- long-term sustainability
- balance sheet strength
- investor confidence
- reserve reinforcement during downturn years

This vault is not greed.

This vault is survival.

---

# 17. LP Vault Allocation Formula

Let:

- `LP_amount` = liquidity portion
- `Claims_share = 0.55`
- `Cat_share = 0.15`
- `Ops_share = 0.12`
- `Growth_share = 0.08`
- `Reins_share = 0.05`
- `Profit_share = 0.05`

Then:

Claims_Vault = LP_amount × 0.55
Catastrophic_Vault = LP_amount × 0.15
Operating_Vault = LP_amount × 0.12
Growth_Vault = LP_amount × 0.08
Reinsurance_Vault = LP_amount × 0.05
Profit_Vault = LP_amount × 0.05


---

# 18. Full Example: Good Driver Policy

Premium paid:

P = 1,000 BMC1usd

Group A:

- MB = 65%
- LP = 35%

So:

MB_amount = 650  
LP_amount = 350  

Now split LP:

- Claims Vault = 350 × 0.55 = 192.5
- Cat Vault = 350 × 0.15 = 52.5
- Operating Vault = 350 × 0.12 = 42
- Growth Vault = 350 × 0.08 = 28
- Reinsurance Vault = 350 × 0.05 = 17.5
- Profit Vault = 350 × 0.05 = 17.5

---

# 19. Full Example: SR22 High Risk Policy

Premium paid:

P = 1,000 BMC1usd

Group B:

- MB = 35%
- LP = 65%

So:

MB_amount = 350  
LP_amount = 650  

Now split LP:

- Claims Vault = 650 × 0.55 = 357.5
- Cat Vault = 650 × 0.15 = 97.5
- Operating Vault = 650 × 0.12 = 78
- Growth Vault = 650 × 0.08 = 52
- Reinsurance Vault = 650 × 0.05 = 32.5
- Profit Vault = 650 × 0.05 = 32.5

---

# 20. Key Insight: SR22 Drivers Subsidize Liquidity

This is exactly correct and extremely powerful.

SR22/high-risk drivers produce:

- higher LP portion
- more risk funding
- stronger sustainability for the ecosystem

This makes the system:

- balanced
- sustainable
- more resilient against claims spikes

---

# 21. The Refund Escrow Vault (MB Vault) Rules

The MB Vault must operate like a locked escrow system.

It must enforce:

- no withdrawals before maturity
- no use for operating costs
- no conversion to company treasury
- only eligible payouts at maturity or settlement event

The MB Vault should be treated as:

> customer locked savings inside a policy contract.

---

# 22. MB Vault Liquidity Restriction

The MB Vault funds must not be invested in risky yield strategies.

If yield is ever added later, it must be:

- extremely conservative
- overcollateralized
- stablecoin-based
- reversible

This avoids systemic collapse.

---

# 23. What Happens if Driver Violates Policy Rules?

This is your most powerful sustainability mechanism.

If the driver violates rules:

- the MB reserve is partially reduced or forfeited
- the forfeited portion transfers into LP vaults

This increases claims liquidity.

---

# 24. Minor Ticket Penalty (2.5% Rule)

Rule:

- Each minor ticket reduces MB % by 2.5%
- Maximum 5 tickets allowed
- Over 5 tickets = cancellation and forfeiture

---

# 25. Ticket Penalty Formula

Let:

- `Tickets_minor`
- `Penalty = 0.025`
- `MB_initial`

Then:

MB_final = MB_initial - (Tickets_minor × Penalty)


But:

Tickets_minor <= 5


---

# 26. Example: 5 Tickets Penalty

Group A driver:

MB_initial = 0.65  
Tickets_minor = 5  

So:

MB_final = 0.65 - (5 × 0.025)  
MB_final = 0.65 - 0.125  
MB_final = 0.525  

Meaning:

- customer refund becomes 52.5%
- company LP increases by 12.5%

---

# 27. Where the Deducted Portion Goes

The deducted MB portion should be redistributed into:

- Claims Vault
- Catastrophic Vault

Recommended distribution of penalties:

| Penalty Reallocation | % |
|----------------------|---|
| Claims Vault | 70% |
| Catastrophic Vault | 30% |

This strengthens survival funding.

---

# 28. Severe Ticket / DUI / Major Violation Rule

Major violations cause:

- immediate MB forfeiture
- immediate cancellation OR
- severe policy penalty event

The forfeited MB balance transfers fully into LP vaults.

---

# 29. Not-at-Fault Accident Rule

If driver has accident not at fault:

- MB eligibility is not reduced
- driver stays in same group
- claim payout happens from Claims Vault

If vehicle is totaled:

- policy ends
- refund is paid only up to date
- new policy begins from year 0

---

# 30. Total Loss Settlement Rule

If total loss occurs:

- policy contract closes
- claim payout occurs
- MB refund is computed up to settlement date
- MB payout is executed
- contract ends
- all remaining funds are reconciled

This ensures no overlapping liabilities.

---

# 31. Five-Year Maturity Rule

At year 5:

- policy contract matures
- refund is calculated
- eligibility is verified
- payout is released

Then:

- policy ends permanently
- renewal is optional
- renewal is a new contract instance

---

# 32. Policy Renewal Rule (Fresh Start)

When policy renews:

- it is treated as new contract
- new MB vault is created
- new LP vault allocations begin
- new oracle monitoring begins

This prevents liability stacking.

---

# 33. Policy Cancellation Rule

Cancellation may occur due to:

- too many tickets
- fraud detection
- non-payment
- severe violations

When cancellation occurs:

- MB funds are forfeited partially or fully
- LP vault receives the forfeited balance

This is one of the strongest sustainability safeguards.

---

# 34. Why the Company Can Still Be Profitable

The company generates profit from:

- profit vault allocations
- operating efficiency
- penalty forfeitures
- yield (optional future)
- stable reserve management
- public token treasury growth
- reinsurance partnerships

This ensures the company can:

- pay staff
- pay claims
- scale operations
- maintain reserves

---

# 35. What About Years With High Claim Frequency?

High-claim years are handled through:

- Claims Vault
- Catastrophic Vault
- Reinsurance Vault (future)

If Claims Vault depletes, Catastrophic Vault provides backup.

This prevents insolvency.

---

# 36. Why the MB Promise Is Still Safe

Because MB funds are escrowed separately.

The company cannot spend MB funds on operations.

So even if claims spike:

- MB escrow remains protected

Unless policy violations trigger forfeiture.

---

# 37. The “Insurance Solvency Formula”

This is the key institutional formula.

Let:

- `ClaimsExpected`
- `ClaimsVaultBalance`
- `CatVaultBalance`

Then solvency requires:

ClaimsVaultBalance + CatVaultBalance >= ClaimsExpected


This must be monitored constantly.

---

# 38. Sustainability Enhancers (Optional Additions)

To strengthen the model further, the company can add:

- deductibles paid by drivers
- co-pay models for minor claims
- bonus MB increases for perfect record
- premium discounts for staking BMC1/BMC1x/BMC1g

---

# 39. Final Recommended Model Summary

## Policy Premium Allocation
- split into MB escrow + LP
- MB locked until maturity
- LP split into multi-vault structure

## LP Multi-Vault Allocation
- claims prioritized
- catastrophic reserves maintained
- operations funded
- growth funded
- profit retained

## Penalties Strengthen Liquidity
- minor tickets reduce MB %
- severe violations cancel and forfeit MB
- forfeited MB strengthens claims funding

## Renewal is Always a New Policy
- prevents overlapping liabilities
- resets eligibility timeline

---

# 40. Closing Statement

The BMC1usd premium distribution model creates a system where:

- customers are incentivized to drive safely
- the company remains financially stable
- claims can be paid reliably
- long-term sustainability is guaranteed through multi-vault reserves
- investors gain confidence from structured reserve discipline

This is the architecture required to build a real insurance company on blockchain.
