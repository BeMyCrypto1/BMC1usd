# 1. Purpose of This Document

This document defines the **Trustee / Special Reserve Account** structure for the BMC1usd ecosystem, including:

- Legal and financial credibility support  
- Liquidity enhancement for BMC1usd internal token  
- Integration with public ERC20 tokens (BMC1, BMC1x, BMC1g)

# 2. Trustee Account Overview

- **Type:** Irrevocable, internal corporate-controlled account  
- **Purpose:** Hold BMC1, BMC1x, BMC1g for liquidity support  
- **Access:** Controlled via smart contracts + internal governance  
- **Locking Period:** Typically 5 years for each deposit tranche  
- **Functionality:**  
  - Gradually convert assets to BMC1usd / USDC / USDT  
  - Support MB payout vaults  
  - Enhance LPs for policy settlement liquidity  
  - Demonstrate solvency and credibility to investors

# 3. Token Flow into Trustee

1. Public ERC20 investments (BMC1, BMC1x, BMC1g) are **allocated into Trustee Vaults**  
2. **Annual conversion formula:**  

Conversion_Amount = Fixed_Amount_Per_Year
BMC1usd_Value = Conversion_Amount * Current_Token_Price


- Price fluctuation of ERC20 tokens does not affect the **fixed conversion amount**  
- Ensures predictable support for MB and LP vaults  

3. Remaining ERC20 tokens stay locked in trustee until next year’s conversion cycle

---

# 4. Integration with MB Vaults and LP

- Converted BMC1usd / USDC / USDT **feeds directly** into:  
  - MB payout vaults  
  - Policy LP reserves  
  - Stability reserves  
- Ensures the internal insurance ecosystem always has a **solid liquidity backbone**

---

# 5. Legal & Investor Considerations

- Trustee structure mimics traditional **irrevocable trust** approach used by institutional investors  
- Provides:  
  - Asset protection from external claims  
  - Auditability for regulators, banks, or angel investors  
  - Clear separation of public investments vs internal insurance token flows  

---

# 6. Locking & Release Mechanics

- Each deposit tranche has **5-year lock-in**  
- At end of lock-in period:  
  - Management can decide to roll into next cycle  
  - Convert additional ERC20 tokens into stable BMC1usd reserves  
- Only smart contracts can trigger conversion and release  
- Manual overrides by internal governance possible in exceptional cases  

---

# 7. Example Scenario

1. Year 1: 100,000 BMC1 allocated to Trustee Vault  
2. Annual conversion: 20,000 BMC1 → BMC1usd vault at 1:1 equivalent  
3. MB vaults now have **fixed BMC1usd liquidity** for policy payouts  
4. Remaining 80,000 BMC1 stays locked for next year’s cycle  
5. Year 2: repeat process with adjusted ERC20 allocations  

- This ensures continuous liquidity support regardless of token market volatility

---

# 8. Notes on What Trustee Account Is Not

- Not a personal or investor wallet  
- Not for speculative trading  
- Does not bypass policy MB or LP rules  
- Does not replace smart contract automation for payouts  
- Cannot be accessed externally without internal governance & smart contract approval  

---

# 9. Closing Statement

The **Trustee & Special Reserve Model** provides:

- Long-term liquidity sustainability  
- Transparent and auditable financial backing  
- Integration with both public ERC20s and internal BMC1usd token  
- Investor credibility and legal protection  

It is a critical piece of the **BMC1 BeMyCoverage1 LLC ecosystem**, ensuring policies can always be settled while maintaining trustworthiness and regulatory compliance.
